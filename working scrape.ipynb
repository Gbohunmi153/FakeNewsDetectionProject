      "['They said he is a well-equipped and more prepared candidate for the task of good governance.  \\xa0 Less than forty-eight hours to the March 18 rescheduled governorship and the house of assembly elections, alignment, and re-alignment amongst political parties continue. To this end, executives of the Labour Party (LP) and the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in Niger State have adopted the gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Umar Bago in the state. They said he is a well-equipped and more prepared candidate for the task of good governance. In their separate remarks, the chairman of the Niger LP Musa Mohammed, and the Secretary of the NNPP Mohammed Kwabo say their decision is not financially induced rather it is for the interest of the state. Bago, who received the party executives and members of the parties, assured that they will work hand in hand for the betterment of the state if he is elected governor of Niger State. A few days before the elections, other parties have also been aligning and re-aligning for what they believe is their interest and that of their political parties in the state. © \\xa0Channels Incorporated Limited. All rights reserved.', 'The ADC said Tonye Cole was chosen as the \"unifier of the opposite parties\" following his track records as a successful businessman and detribalised politician.  The African Democratic Congress ADC which has Actress Tonto Dike as its Deputy Governorship Candidate in Rivers State has withdrawn from the race. The ADC said it pulled out of the race to form a formidable alliance with the All Progressives Congress (APC) to produce the next governor of the state. The decision of the party was disclosed by its Governorship Candidate, Tonte Ibraye at a media briefing which was also attended by the APC Candidate, Tonye Cole in Port Harcourt on Thursday. He said Cole was chosen as the “unifier of the opposite parties” following his track records as a successful businessman and detribalised politician. The ADC governorship candidate, Tonte Ibraye appealed to the other candidates in the Rivers West Senatorial District where he and Cole come from to support the APC. He denied that he and Dike or the leaders of the party were paid to take the decision. He, however, said the Assembly candidates of the ADC are still in the race. Responding to the last-minute favourable decision, the APC Candidate said the event marks a new beginning for the restoration of a progressives Rivers State. He described the ADC governorship and deputy governorship candidates as people of integrity who downplayed monetary gains for a progressive Rivers State. He stated with confidence that he will win the March 18 governorship election in the state. Cole called on the residents of the state to be courageous to step out to vote, noting that the military and the police have assured of security.

It added that “specifically, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the provision of Section 84 (13) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which provides that; “Where a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue” “In the words of the Supreme Court, “Section 84 (13) of the Electoral Act is quite clear on the effect of failure to comply with the provisions of the Act and the Guideline of a Political Party in the selection or nomination of a candidate for election. Its Candidate shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue”. According to the PDP, the implication of the Supreme Court’s Judgment therefore is that INEC is effectively restrained from accepting or recognizing any governorship candidate from the APC for the March 18, 2023 Governorship election in Taraba State. The party said INEC must therefore be guided by the hierarchy of courts in Nigeria and the finality of the pronouncements in the Judgment of the Supreme Court on any issue or subject upon which it has ruled, ordered or given judgment. The PDP also asserted that the people of Taraba State must note that any vote therefore cast or credited to the APC in the March 18, 2023 Governorship election in Taraba State will be treated as wasted vote. © \\xa0Channels Incorporated Limited.

He has his plans for Taraba” “He has been in the grassroots politics, he has been in the house of reps, senatorial and was a minister in Goodluck Jonathan administration.” “Senator Joel Is ready for this election, he has the track record, he has the character, and he has the capacity to lead the people” Mr Benjamin said that the new primary conducted was for the purpose of reducing the tension from the court, to which the two candidates were invited. He also added that he wrote a letter to the spokesperson of Munlip adding that the chairperson had passed across the information of the primary but Munlip claimed that the letter came late in the night and he was not properly informed that the primaries were supposed to take place. According to him, Munlip was within his right to withdraw from participation in the primary poll. “It is within his right to do that (to withdraw), and to take that decision but it is not scattering the party in any way, the party is still focused, and we are closing rounds together with the PCC, with all our candidates and with all our stakeholders, with all local government chairmen.” He said that the party is on the same page to ensure the successful picture of the party towards 18 March, adding that Ikenya has his strategies ready and he is at the heart of the people.

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Sunday said over 170,000 polling unit results of the February 25 presidential and National Assembly elections have been uploaded on its Result Viewing Portal (IReV). The Commission also said the reconfiguration of the Bimodal Voter Registration Systems (BVAS) would be completed by Tuesday in preparation for the March 18 governorship and state assembly elections. “As at the last time, over 170,000 of those results have been uploaded,” INEC National Commissioner, Festus Okoye, stated on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics. \\xa0  \\xa0 “As you are aware, we are reconfiguring the BVAS for purposes of the governorship and state assembly elections, and any BVAS that was used for the presidential and National Assembly elections that do not push to the accreditation backend, the data relating to the conduct of the presidential and National Assembly elections will not be reconfigured. “In fact, the BVAS will not allow itself to be reconfigured or reset if the entire data is not pushed to the accreditation backend. “I’m sure that by Tuesday when we hope to complete the resettling of the BVAS for the purposes of the governorship and state assembly elections, the results in all the places where elections were conducted would have been pushed to the accreditation backend.” \\xa0 \\xa0 Okoye said every Nigerian has the constitutional and legal right to protest. However, he said no political party will be allowed to look into the brain of the BVAS or the biometrics of voters. He noted that INEC is the regulator of political parties and the commission won’t abdicate its core responsibility to aggrieved political parties. He said the court judgement that voters could use their temporary voter cards to vote is not applicable for all Nigerians but for the individuals who went to court.\\nThe INEC commissioner also blamed political parties for making polling units “inaccessible” for voters, leading to low turnout at the last polls. He said INEC learned some “valuable lessons” in the presidential and National Assembly elections, which would be used in the governorship and state assembly polls. He said serious efforts are being made to rectify challenges with IReV portal ahead of the March 18 polls, adding that the ICT department of the commission knows what to do if there are issues with the uploading of polling unit results on the IReV portal in March 18 polls. He said political parties deployed more polling unit agents than the number of officials deployed by the Commission and so they monitored their results per polling units. The INEC commissioner said, “The Electoral Act 2022 makes it clear that every registered political party in conjunction with their candidates have the right to send agents to every polling units in Nigeria. The PDP as a political party deployed a total of 176,588 polling agents. The Labour Party deployed a total of 134,874 polling agents. The NNPP deployed a total of 176,200 while the APC deployed a total of 176,223. “The commission deployed to 176,666 polling units. So, the political parties deployed more agents to the polling units than the number of polling units that opened. What that means is that each political party got a copy of Form EC 8 which is the polling unit result sheet which is the result sheet that is uploaded into the IReV portal.” The IReV and the BVAS are new technologies introduced by the electoral body for the accreditation and electronic transmission of votes for this year’s polls. At the presidential and National Assembly polls, opposition parties complained bitterly that INEC officials at the polling units were unable to upload election results electronically to the IReV, as stipulated by Section 60 of the Electoral Act 2022. The parties kicked against the manual collation of results and the announcement of winners in the polls. The electoral body promised to fix the glitches but opposition parties have gone to court to challenge the victory of Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who was declared Nigeria’s President-Elect by the electoral umpire. Last week, a Court of Appeal in Nigeria’s political capital, Abuja granted approval to INEC to reconfigure the BVAS for the governorship and state assembly elections. The Labour Party (LP) and its presidential candidate Peter Obi had sought an order from the court restraining INEC from tampering with the information in the BVAS machines until the due inspection is conducted and certified true copies (CTC) of them issued. But on Wednesday, a three-member panel of the court of appeal led by Justice Joseph Ikyegh granted INEC’s request to reconfigure the BVAS machines on the ground that the information on them would be uploaded into the back-end server which cannot be tampered with. The commission subsequently postponed the governorship and state assembly polls by one week from March 11 to March 18 to allow for the reconfiguration of BVAS machines. © \\xa0Channels Incorporated Limited.

But I think the personnel that are mounting these roadblocks must tone down in terms of trying to make sure that people get to their location of voting,” he stated. “If you look at probably the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), you will know a particular citizen is going to vote, he should be allowed to access his area of voting so that he can be able to exercise his franchise. “I want to also believe that probably because of the fear of the unknown, they were very stern and still.

The whole of South -South and South-East that PDP lost, if Obi did not contest PDP would have won.” He further added, “The hero is this election is Obi whether you like it or not. I am not here to please you, Obi is the hero. He may not have been pronounced as the winner, no problem, the law will take its course. If Obi did not run this election, power would have remained in the North. Whether he declared a winner now or not, history will be on his side that he fought and fought well.” The Rivers State governor said the reason why he did not publicly declare support for any presidential candidate was because the PDP G-5 governors had unanimously agreed to ensure the emergence of a president from southern Nigeria to succeed President Buhari. Governor Wike, said while members of the G-5 governors assiduously\\nworked for power to return to the South, the likes of former Rivers State governor and immediate past Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, who is now soliciting for Igbo to support APC candidate, Tonye Cole, mobilised votes for Atiku Abubakar. “If Amaechi loves the Igbos, why did he not support Obi? Instead, he supported Atiku. He did not want power to return to the South because he lost APC ticket.” The governor said the reason why Amaechi is deliberately canvassing support for Tonye Cole is because he wants stall their on going prosecution for embezzling $50M from the Rivers State government coffers. Governor Wike urged Igbos in Rivers State to be wary of Amaechi, who served as Minister of Transportation for over seven years, but failed to revive eastern ports and railway lines from Enugu-Aba-Port Harcourt. The governor recalled that when Amaechi was the Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly, he vehemently opposed plan to compensate Igbos who lost their property in the State during the civil war.

Following INEC’s declaration of Tinubu as the President-elect last Thursday, Atiku slammed the conduct of the elections, saying the umpire’s inability to upload results on the INEC Results Viewing Portal (IReV) is a “rape of democracy”. But Wike mocked the PDP leaders while speaking at the commissioning of Igwuruta internal roads in the Ikwerre Local Government Area (LGA) of Rivers State. “I won three of the Senate seats – three over three. Ask them, did they win three over three? You cannot win!” the governor said. “I told them; they said they would conspire against me. Those who said they’ll conspire against me are those wearing black. I am wearing white and they’re wearing black.” Wike, who is a member of the G5, the group of five aggrieved PDP governors who abstained from campaigning for Atiku on the grounds that his candidacy allegedly violated the party’s constitution. In the build-up to the presidential election, the rift between the G5, a group of five aggrieved PDP governors, including Wike, and the party’s national leadership proved irreconcilable. Unequivocal about the presidential seat returning to the South, the governor is widely believed to have spearheaded the APC’s unprecedented win in Rivers. He however denies being involved in any anti-party activity, saying he fought for the unity of the country. To him, the alleged anti-party actions belong to “them at the national level in PDP”. Wike pondered what could be “more anti-party” than party members abandoning the provisions of their constitution that talk about zoning of elective and appointive offices. “[Between] you that refused to obey the constitution of your party because of impunity, because you think you have the number, you refused to obey the provisions of the constitution of your party, and we that say Nigeria must be one, Nigeria must be united, Nigeria must work for our people, [and] let everybody have hope, who committed anti-party [activities]? They are the ones who committed anti-party [misconduct],” he said. On the fallout of the election, Wike assured PDP supporters the first phase of “the war” is over, adding that the second phase is about to begin. “The second phase of the war: We must chase out the buccaneers and vampires. We are going to chase them out of the party and take our party and rebuild our party,” he said. \\xa0 © \\xa0Channels Incorporated Limited.

We have, over the last four years, left no doubt as to how deeply committed we are, in our quest to positively transform the fortunes of Lagos State on behalf of all its people. “Let me also say that, regardless of how we may have wanted the presidential elections to go, we are all united, as Lagosians, by the compelling dream of a Greater Lagos. “This is why I am extending an invitation to you, to support this all-important task of bettering our State, by voting for me, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu on March 11. I promise to continue to serve you with seriousness and diligence, and to continue the journey towards a Lagos that is the most dynamic and prosperous state in the country.” Speaking on why he should be re-elected, Governor Sanwo-Olu said his administration has achieved a lot in his first term with the completion of many laudable and iconic projects. The Governor promised to complete all the ongoing projects and do more in his second term if re-elected. He said: “There is so much that we have been able to accomplish over the last four years, and much more we can achieve over the next four, with your support. “The first Phase of the Blue Line Rail has been completed, and the Red Line will equally be completed very soon. The Lekki-Epe Expressway is undergoing reconstruction from Ajah to Epe T-Junction; we have recently completed the section of it between Eleko Junction and Epe. “Work is at an advanced phase on the new Lekki Regional Road that will serve as an alternative to the Lekki-Epe Expressway, connecting Freedom Way to VGC. We are investing in several new hospitals, upgrading our public schools, and empowering pupils and teachers with digital tools to improve teaching and learning outcomes. “We have attracted billions of dollars into major infrastructure and manufacturing projects in our dear State, including the newly commissioned Lekki Deep Sea Port, which will create tens of thousands of jobs and uplift the economy of Lekki. We are pushing ahead with the construction of the 4th Mainland Bridge that will connect Lekki to the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.” Governor Sanwo-Olu stressed further that “Indeed, there are many more transformational projects and programs that space will not permit me to outline here, that will yield massive dividends for all of us in Lagos State in the years and decades ahead. “I seek from you the opportunity to complete these laudable projects and programs, and many more, which you can make possible by re-electing me as Governor of Lagos State on March 11, 2023. “I thank you for your time and attention, and I look forward to serving you again, with humility, passion and diligence, for the next four years.” SIGNED GBOYEGA AKOSILE CHIEF PRESS SECRETARY 07 MARCH 2023 © \\xa0Channels Incorporated Limited.

The state LP Chairman, Dienye Pepple, had held a press conference during which he announced the party’s alleged support for the PDP candidate, Siminalayi Fubara. This however did not go down well with some members of LP who have been making their displeasure felt, saying the Chairman does not speak for the party and that he may have been compromised by the promise of financial rewards. This much was made known by the deputy governorship candidate of the party during a chat with Channels Television at the party’s campaign office in Port Harcourt, the state capital.

He also accused Pepple of sabotaging the party during the presidential election.

The standard bearers for Labour Party (LP), Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour; Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Abdul-Azeez Adediran aka Jandor; and National Rescue Movement (NRM), Akin Braithwaite, laid their plans bare on Monday’s edition of Channels Television’s Politics Today. Rhodes-Vivour, who hopes to maintain the LP’s momentum in the presidential election that saw Peter Obi coasting to an unprecedented victory in the Centre of Excellence, spoke about improving the employment situation and leading an accountable administration.\\xa0\\xa0 For Jandor, who spearheads the foremost opposition party in previous governorship elections, his candidacy is no accident, but a project seven years in the making. On his part, Braithwaite is concerned about an impending uprising caused by an unemployment crisis and plans to tackle the issue by creating programmes that provide jobs. The LP candidate says his party is offering a “unique proposition”: a Lagos that works for the people and is centred on transparency and accountability.  Rhodes-Vivour’s promise is a Lagos in which innovation will be the key guiding principle and that the issue of tax-collecting thugs commonly referred to as agberos will be curbed. “We’ll also have a Lagos that will be free from the agbero situation because we’ll convert these young men that are wasting their lives away on the streets, gaining N120 billion every year for some unknown person that’s not accounted for, and we’ll give them skills that will allow them to be productive members of society,” he said. The architect promised platforms that would be provided to deliver the dividends of democracy for the people of Lagos, adding that development would not be tied to the apron strings of the state government. Assuring Lagosians he would run an open and transparent government, he said his sole focus would be on regaining the trust of the people, industries, and the private sector. Rhodes-Vivour added that his administration would ensure that Lagosians have a state that is number one in terms of ease of doing business.  “We have a Lagos that actual waste management happens in, not the current situation of picking and dumping; a waste management that is domiciled at the local government level. “We’re looking to ensure that we have a robust local government system that’s manned by people that are potential governors, visionaries, and people that love their people and are committed to creating the best local governments and delivering the best possible services,” he said. As Jandor puts it, before you can proffer a solution to a problem, you must first have a full understanding of that problem.  His observation was the “story of somebody who just handpicks [s] someone who never prepared to be in office”. This formed the backdrop of what he described as a seven-year sojourn in public administration, during which “we started going around everywhere in the state of Lagos so that we first have a full understanding of the state of our state”. According to him, with the wealth of Lagos today, the state should have iconic road infrastructure and bridges.  “You don’t need anybody to keep telling you Lagos is rich and what we [always] hear is, Lagos is a rich state. We need to see that wealth on the streets of Lagos.  “When you go to Dubai, you don’t need anybody to tell you Dubai is rich. The moment you enter Dubai – you don’t even need to ask for their bank balance. But in Lagos, it’s only what we hear,” he said. Speaking on the necessity for the unburdening of the state’s ever-congested road networks, the PDP candidate expressed a need to be deliberate in ensuring that he and his government “open up the space”. He said, “In terms of transportation if you want to decongest the Lagos CBD, you will start from the number of people that go on the Third Mainland Bridge in the morning from the mainland. What are we going to do? “On the left side, you’ll see an expanse of land at Oworonsoki; we are going to build a park and ride there and dredge that water all the way.  “We’ll come up with a policy: if you’re the only one in your car, you’re not going on Third Mainland Bridge.

Etiaba, who appeared in a Monday interview on Channels Television’s morning show, Sunrise Daily, said aggrieved citizens should not speculate about the outcome of the election as the electoral body still had a week to review the results. “Section 72 of the Electoral Act gives INEC 14 days to announce results and that there was no need to rush; they are still within time, they still have seven days to review the election results,” he said. “The law is the law; the law insists that law is what it is, not what an individual says it is.”  He also spoke on the open letter by Olisa Agbakoba, a counterpart of his, addressed to the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, and the multiple interpretations of Section 134 (2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution as amended. The section provides that a candidate can only be declared winner of a presidential election “if he has not less than one-quarter of the votes cast at the election each of at least two-thirds of all the States in the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.” Etiaba, the governorship candidate in Anambra State on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), also faulted the declaration of Tinubu as the winner of the presidential election.

According to him, in law, “it is settled that when you have a list in a legislation, any other thing that is not within that list is excluded. FCT is not one of the states, and it is totally excluded from the states by the constitution, which is the ground norm.” Etiaba also cited the previous constitution, saying it made no mention of FCT (Abuja) because the FCT was not in place then, and Lagos was the capital. © \\xa0Channels Incorporated Limited.

The PDP called on the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, to urgently deploy resources to remove dangerous weapons in possession of thugs in service of the main opposition party in the state. In a statement signed by its Caretaker Chairman, Dr Akindele Adekunle on Sunday, the party said the APC has become increasingly desperate following its woeful performance in the presidential and national assembly elections last on February 25, warning of a serious danger to the state and its people if the Police chief failed to act in time. READ ALSO: Bandits Attack Local Govt HQ In Zamfara, Kill DPO, Two Others Dr Akindele said the people of Iree in Boripe local government have been in fear for the past three days, because a former APC Commissioner and his thugs have been shooting sporadically into the air. The PPD chieftain added that the scenario is the same in Ayedade local government where the APC Assembly candidate allegedly led thugs to kill several Fulani cows in the despicable act of intimidating people. “Since the outcome of Saturday election was made known, people of Iree town in Boripe local government have been leaving in palpable fear as the sound of gunshots forced many of the residents to remain indoors. “To our dismay, there was no military operation in that axis to have warranted such level of gunshots, rather, it was a former Commissioner in Gboyega Oyetola government and his thugs acting with reckless impunity,” Akindele noted. “We understand that he was livid at the poor performance of the APC in the election and angry at the people for making their democratic choice. So, he wants to scare them and make sure they don’t come out on March 11 to exercise their franchise as enshrined in the Constitution. “Similar despicable act is being experience in Ayedade local government, and just recently, the APC candidate led thugs to kill several fulani cows. This is an overreach and we strongly call on the IGP to swing into action before APC sets Osun on fire out of its desperation.” The PDP reminded the Police chief of the devastating loss it suffered in the hands of the APC and its thugs in the build up to the February 25 election, asking the police chief to prevent any repeat. “Before the February 25th election, the APC went on violent spree and the PDP suffered hugely. In Ikire, Irewole local government. Two PDP members were gunned down by the APC in the houses at the dead of the night, and in Ilesa, three PDP members were crudely murdered in broad-day light by the APC,” he recalled. “PDP member in Osogbo, Ife, Boripe and other parts of the state were casualties of the APC rascality and unreasonable campaign of violence. In spite of all these loses, the PDP did not retaliate and instead, trusting the law that justice will take its course. “Governor Adeleke has consistently warned against violence, which the PDP strictly adhered to. This is more reason why we are calling on the IGP to come to the rescue of Osun people and save it from the impending bloodletting that the APC is planning to execute. “It is no longer secret that the APC is no longer acceptable to Osun people, hence, its resort to violence as captured in a leaked conversation on its plan for the March 11 election.

He pointed out that, Nasarawa State has always been seen as a peaceful state and as such cannot afford to allow politics to divide the people. “The essence of the meeting in reality is because of a very unfortunate situation that is beginning to unfold in our state. “We have always been seen as a state that is very peaceful, a state that has been able to receive not only the multi ethnic groups that we have in the state but also the various religions. In Nasarawa State, just like in other states, you can find from the same mother and father, those who practise the two different religions. “It’s not out of place to find partners also who are in that category. And definitely, it’s not out of place also to find siblings that belong to the two different religions. We cannot afford whatsoever, to begin a religious war in Nasarawa State,” he stated. Engineer Sule pleaded with the religious leaders to intercede by using their offices to caution their followers on the use of inciting utterances for political gains. He emphasized that, religious crisis will only set the development of the state backward, just like religious crisis destroyed Beirut, one of the most beautiful cities in the Middle East. “I think a lot of you who visit the social media have seen a lot of voices, people who are tearing the state apart in the name of politics. Politics is not about destruction, it’s about presenting who you are, what you are and get elected. We can’t be using politics of religion and ethnicity because these will not be the basis for electing people,” he stated.

Relatively obscure in the political arena before now, LP, which was previously known as the Party for Social Democracy (PSD), gained unprecedented popularity with what has been described by many as the Peter Obi phenomenon. The milestone of LP in the just-concluded elections for the red and green chambers is no doubt credited to the fame and acceptance of the party’s flag bearer by an overwhelming youth majority known as ‘Obidients’. The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu at a meeting with Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) on Saturday, said, “In last Saturday’s elections, winners have also been declared for 423 national legislative seats while supplementary elections will be held in 46 constituencies. “In the Senate, 98 out of 109 seats have been declared. So far, seven political parties have won senatorial seats while in the House of Representatives, 325 out of 360 seats have been won by eight political parties.” In terms of party representation for the 10th Assembly, the INEC chief said APC won 57 Senate seats; the PDP, 29; LP, 6; SDP, 2; NNPP, 2; YPP, 1; and APGA, 1. For the lower chamber, the electoral chair said the APC has 162 seats; PDP, 102; LP, 34; NNPP, 18; APGA, 4; ADC, 2; SDP, 2; YPP, 1. \\xa0  \\xa0 Yakubu also said Certificates of Return would be presented to Senators-elect on Tuesday at the National Collation Centre (the International Conference Centre), Abuja, while Members of the House of Representatives-elect would receive theirs the following day, Wednesday at the same venue. Compared to its phenomenal stride in the 2023 elections, the LP did not get a single seat in the 2019 National Assembly elections. Four years ago, out of the 360 seats in the house, the All Progressives Congress (APC) won the majority seats with over 211 members and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) got over 111 members. The other seats were shared amongst the smaller parties. For the Senate, the APC commanded the Senate majority with 64 senators, trailed by the PDP with 44 and the Young Progressives Party (YPP) with a single seat. The figures have since changed with the series of defections in the 9th National Assembly. Obi, the trader and former Anambra State governor changing the game and leading the new third force in Nigeria’s political sphere, was able to galvanise the support of millions of youths, especially in southern Nigeria, in less than a year since he moved to the LP from the PDP. Obi, 61, was adjudged by INEC to have lost the presidential election after having won 12 states, including Lagos and other former strongholds of the two previously dominant parties with a total of 6,101,533 votes. INEC subsequently on Wednesday declared Bola Tinubu of the ruling APC winner of the contest, having scored 8,794,726 votes ahead of Obi; and Atiku Abubakar of the PDP who scored 6,984,520 votes. Although Obi has vowed to head to court to challenge the results of the presidential poll on the claim that he won the election, citing the failure of the electoral umpire to transmit results electronically, widespread rigging and reports of violence and disruption at many polling units during the poll, many observers would argue that the 2023 NASS election, especially, was a fairly good start for the ‘Obidient’ family. With the March 11, 2023 governorship and state assemblies’ elections just days away, ‘Obidients’, who seem to be causing a political hailstorm in Nigeria at the moment despite claims of having no structure, are bent on producing LP governors and state assembly members, especially in states where Obi won the presidential poll. Nigerians will be electing 28 state governors come next Saturday in the seasonal poll.

Wike taunted the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, saying he has no option but to comply with the decision of the apex court. “I thank God the Supreme Court today has told them the old money remains valid till the end of December. “So, if you still have the old money, use it. The highest court of the land has said so. “Too bad for the governor of Central Bank. He has no choice. There is no other directive that can override the judgement of the Supreme Court,” Wike said just after the apex court verdict in Abuja. Wike spoke on Friday when he joined his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde to commission the Oyo State 5,000,000-litre Aviation Fuel Dispensing Depot at the Ibadan Airport in the Alakia area of the state.  \\xa0 The governor also called for true federalism and restructuring, saying there are many resources that should be controlled by state governments and not the Federal Government. He said the Federal Government should refund Oyo State the money the government invested in the aviation fuel project or hand over the airport to the Makinde-led government. “That is why we are talking about true federalism; that is why we are talking about restructuring. Certain things that the Federal Government gives to itself but will not perform. All they do by the end of the month is to collect a high percentage and begin to do all kinds of things,” he said. Earlier, the apex court also nullified the Federal Government’s naira redesign policy, declaring it as an affront to the 1999 Constitution. The court said the policy has led to some people engaging in trade by barter in this modern age in a bid to survive. Sixteen states led by Kaduna, Kogi, and Zamfara prayed to the apex court to void and set aside the policy on the ground that it is inflicting hardships on innocent Nigerians. The CBN had extended the deadline for the swap of old N200, N500, and N1,000 from January 31 to February 10 following complaints by many Nigerians but the Supreme Court, after a suit filed by the states, held that the Federal Government, the CBN, commercial banks must not continue with the February 10 deadline pending the determination of a notice in respect of the issue. However, President Muhammadu Buhari, in a national broadcast, directed the apex bank to release old N200 notes into circulation to co-exist with new N200, N500, and N1,000 banknotes for 60 days — by April 10, 2023. He also said old N500 and N1,000 banknotes cease to be legal tender in Nigeria. Consequently, the apex court on Friday voided the President’s declaration as well as the naira redesign deadline issued by the CBN and said disobedience of the February 8 order is a sign of dictatorship. © \\xa0Channels Incorporated Limited.

Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State on Friday thanked Nigerians for supporting the return of power to Southern Nigeria. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governor said the issue of rotational presidency has been settled for good with the emergence of a President-Elect, Bola Tinubu, who is from the southern region of the country. Wike spoke today when he joined his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde to commission the Oyo State 5,000,000-litre Aviation Fuel Dispensing Depot at the Ibadan Airport in the Alakia area of the state. In the buildup to the February 25 presidential poll, Wike, who lost the PDP primary to his party’s flag bearer, Atiku Abubakar last May, was unapologetically vocal about his opposition to the 2023 presidential ambition of the former Vice-President. On Friday, the Rivers governor expressed delight that Makinde is one of those that backed power shift to the south after the eight-year tenure of the incumbent Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari who is from Katsina State in the North-West geopolitical zone. Wike said, “I am happy he (Makinde) is one of those that made history by making sure that power shift to the south. “I have told people that those who fight for change, who fight for revolution may not be directed beneficiaries of that fight but today, history has it that all of us now are aware that when power finishes from the south, it will go to the north; when it finishes from the north, it will come to the south. “So, it does not need to be written in the constitution at all before it is implemented. And I thank Nigerians for standing firm to see that this issue materialise.” \\xa0  \\xa0 Wike and Makinde are members of the G5 or the ‘Integrity Group’ who are aggrieved governors of the PDP. The G5 is made up of five PDP governors — Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Seyi Makinde (Oyo) and Nyesom Wike (Rivers). The five governors formed an alliance after the party’s presidential primary in May 2022, to demand that the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu step down for a southern replacement as a precondition to support the presidential ambition of the party’s flag bearer, Atiku Abubakar in the February 25 poll. Both Atiku and Ayu called the governors’ bluff and did not succumb to their demands in the just-concluded elections. Tinubu had on February 15 met with Wike in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, the latest of their many engagements known to the public and the governor had defended their meeting, saying he is free to receive anyone. For the presidential election, Atiku lost in all the G5 states while Labour Party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi won Enugu and Abia, Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) raked in Oyo, Benue and Rivers. Tinubu, 70, came out tops in 12 of Nigeria’s 36 states, and secured significant numbers in several other states to claim the highest number of votes — 8,794,726, almost two million votes more than his closest rival, Atiku. Atiku, 76, who has now run for president six times, got 6,984,520 votes, while Obi, who, in less than a year, galvanised young voters in a manner some have described as unprecedented finished the race with 6,101,533. © \\xa0Channels Incorporated Limited.

The plaintiffs in the originating summons marked: SC/CV/354/2023, are specifically asking for an order of the apex court, “directing a holistic review of all results so far announced by the Federal Government of Nigeria through the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) which were carried out other than through the manner prescribed by the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022, the INEC Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Elections, 2022; and the INEC Manual for Election Officials”.

They further claimed that the widespread violent protests, demonstrations and rallies endangered the peace, order, good governance, security and safety of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs argued that the federal government through INEC, “is empowered by law to correct the elections due to technical glitches and errors arising from the conduct of the elections with substantial effect on the electoral process in line with the provisions of Section 47 (3) of the Electoral Act, 2022; and other relevant sections thereof. “The Federal Government of Nigeria has nonetheless continued to collate results for the Presidential and National Assembly elections, against the provisions of extant Electoral laws and Guidelines, notwithstanding the fundamental flaws identified in the process of the collation of results and the public outcry that has greeted the entire electoral process. “Whilst queries were being raised as to the failure or deliberate refusal of INEC to transmit the results electronically, INEC suddenly pulled down its portal harbouring the Regulations and Guidelines, thus leaving the plaintiffs in the dark. “Most Nigerians, including the governments and peoples of Adamawa State, Akwa Ibom State, Bayelsa State, Delta State, Edo State, and Sokoto State, are entitled to a proper and electoral lawful process and procedure that guarantees a free, fair, transparent and credible election. “There is no justifiable basis for the ongoing collation of results without compliance with the mandatory provisions of the law that mandatorily require the use of BVAs, electronic transmission to the IRev Portal. “Unless this Honourable court intervenes, the Governments and peoples of Adamawa State, Akwa Ibom State, Bayelsa State, Delta State, Edo State, and Sokoto State, who have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable hardship and damage of unquantifiable proportions by being denied the opportunity to participate fairly in a free, transparent, fair and credible election, which can lead to a breakdown of law and order and thus endanger the public peace, security, safety, order and good governance, consequent upon the violent demonstrations and protests that have already started to take place in different parts of the country, including the Plaintiff States, as a result of the fundamentally flawed electoral process, which does not represent the wishes of Nigerians and of the plaintiff states,” they submitted.

Peter Obi has won in 11 states so far.  \\xa0 Gradually, the nation seems to be coming to the closing chapter of the 2023 Presidential and National Assembly elections, but it is quite not the end yet.\\xa0 There are still a few more boxes that need to be ticked before we can say it is all over. While we cannot say for certain at this moment who will win this election, however, here are 11 major developments that we have noted and believe everyone should be aware of at this moment. At the moment the results of at least 35 states and the FCT are known. Ekiti was the first state to be officially announced, and afterwards, the Independent National Electoral Commission announced the results for 25 other states including (Kwara, Osun, Ondo, Ogun, Oyo, Yobe, Enugu, Lagos, Gombe, Jigawa, Adamawa, Katsina, Niger, Edo, Benue, Kogi, Akwa Ibom, Nasarawa, Abia, Bauchi, Kaduna, Plateau, Bayelsa, Zamfara, Kano and FCT). States whose results we already know but have not been announced at the National Collation Centre in Abuja include (Ebonyi, Imo, Cross River, Delta, Kebbi, Sokoto, Taraba, Anambra, and Rivers). The outcome of the polls in Borno State is the only one currently expected. The functionality of the IReV and BVAS have been a huge talking point all through the elections, especially within the collation stage of the process. Some party agents on Monday staged a walk-off at the International Conference Centre where the national collation is taking place. However, many others have stayed back and INEC has continued to see that the IReV begins to function as expected. At this time of writing this, about 103,492 polling units’ results have been uploaded, out of the 176,846 polling units we have. This leaves us with 73,354 polling units more to go. With the figures obtained at this time, the All Progressives Congress (APC) currently leads in terms of the number of votes polled (6.5 million). The PDP is currently in second place with 5.1 million votes while the Labour Party comes in a distant 3rd place with 3.1 million votes. While the numbers are in favour of the APC, the PDP has won more states than any other party at this time, however, the winner of this election will not be determined by how many states one has won but by how many votes they polled. Aggrieved with the result collation process, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Labour Party (LP) and African Democratic Congress (ADC) have demanded a fresh election, saying the February 25 presidential election has been “irretrievably compromised”. According to the parties, Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections were manipulated by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at polling units by their failure to upload results electronically on the commission’s Results Viewing Portal (IReV). The election is a dynamic one and that has continued to reflect in the results of the National Assembly Polls. A couple of serving governors who were hoping to move into the Senate saw their legislative dreams brought to a halt. At least six outgoing governors failed in their attempts to make it to Nigeria’s Senate after their two-term tenure of eight years each. \\xa0 The elections took a little ugly shape in Rivers State where a collation officer for the presidential election (SCOPs), Prof Charles Adias adjourned the collation of results for February 25, 2023 election over an alleged threat to his life by unnamed party supporters. Prof Adias who is also the Vice Chancellor of the Federal University, Otueke announced the adjournment on Tuesday morning while addressing journalists at the State Collation Centre in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. The Commissioner of Police of the Presidential Election in Rivers, Aderemi Adeoye, appealed to the SCOPs to reveal the names of those threatening his life, Adias insisted that he won’t proceed until the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state addressed some of the issues of those threatening him raised This includes the faulty Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS). With tensions being on the high side, stakeholders have started to sue for calm, peace and order. One respected leader who has been calling for order and a following of due processes is former President Olusegun Obasanjo. The ex-military leader appealed to the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu to save the country from impending danger by rectifying the errors in the recent elections. Similarly, human rights lawyer Femi Falana has called into question the credibility of last Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections, accusing security personnel, electoral staff, and state governors of undermining the process. Falana said he has not been impressed by the very disappointing outing on the part of the Independent National Electoral Commission. The government did not take the inferences of the statesmen kindly. In an almost instant clap back, the Federal Government urged former President Olusegun Obasanjo not to truncate the 2023 general elections with his “inciting, self-serving and provocative letter on the polls”. The government said what the former President “cunningly” framed as an “appeal for caution and rectification” was nothing but a calculated attempt to undermine the electoral process and a willful incitement to violence. The 2023 presidential election has not been without bloodshed. While the violence has been pronounced as used to be in previous elections, some deaths were recorded within the course of the polls. An official of INEC in Delta State was killed two days after the elections. The official was killed in the Ukwani Local Government Area of Delta. Authorities said INEC staff were on their way back to Asaba to deliver the results of the local government when the unfortunate incident occurred. In another development, two persons died on Sunday in an attack on the campaign office of a House of Representatives candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in Kano State. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Abdullahi Kiyawa, who made the disclosure in a statement on Monday, noted that a group of suspected thugs set the office ablaze with two unidentified persons in a stationary vehicle inside the building burnt to death. There were several reports of collations disrupted by thugs. One major incident was experienced in Jos, and\\xa0 Delta, while Rivers State was not left out, however, men of the Police Force were able to stop the hoodlums trying to undermine the electoral process before things went out of hand. Many results are coming in and tempers are rising, however, the lawmakers in the House of Representatives believe that Nigeria will remain at peace. Speaker of the House upon resumption today, said the nation will defeat the cynicism of those waiting to see the worst predictions for the country become real. “Nigeria will be at peace, we will work through the law and due process to resolve differences, settle disputes and ensure the peaceful transition of power,” Femi Gbajabiamila stated. At this moment, the National Collation exercise is on a short pause and the electoral umpire says more results will be announced upon resumption within the next two hours. It is still unclear which of the candidates will be able to satisfy the necessary requirement needed to become President of Nigeria. © \\xa0Channels Incorporated Limited.

All rights reserved.', 'The Civic Tech Organisations said INEC cannot downplay the electronic transmission of results at this point of the process.  \\xa0 Two civic tech organisations, PROMAD and Policy Shapers, have\\nasked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to publish the comprehensive report of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) across the country alongside the results of the presidential polls. According to a joint statement signed by Daisi Omokungbe and Ebenezar Wikina, founders of the organisations, Saturday’s presidential poll showed the promise of Nigeria’s democracy becoming citizen-driven, participatory, and energetic. However, the civic tech organisations say having keenly watched and read the reports of events in the election, it appears that INEC has not effectively lived up to its obligations and mandate to Nigerians as defined in her 2023 Electoral Guidelines and the 2022 Electoral Act. “For instance, there are indications of contraventions observed in the processes of the poll across the country, such as late arrival and commencement of voting procedures, relocation of collation centres and failure of the IReV platform. “According to Connected Development, which deployed 20,000 observers, “we have several reports indicating that states like Ekiti, Cross River, Imo, and Rivers State have had their Local Government Area (LGA) collation centres relocated without adequate information to stakeholders. “In Ekiti precisely, we have it on good authority that all LGA collation centres were relocated. In most cases, accredited observers were outrightly denied access, and new locations were shrouded in secrecy”. “INEC itself issued a statement on the challenges they were facing with the Election Results Viewing portal (IReV), a platform they promised to use to aid election transparency and integrity in line with the Electoral Act, 2022. “According to Section 47 of the Act “(1) A person intending to vote in an election shall present himself with his voter’s card to a Presiding officer for accreditation at the polling unit in the constituency in which his name is registered. “(2) To vote, the presiding officer shall use a smart card reader or any other technological device that may be prescribed by the Commission, for the accreditation of voters, to verify, confirm, or authenticate the particulars of the intending voter in the manner prescribed by the Commission. “(3) Where a smart card reader or any other technological device\\ndeployed for accreditation of voters fails to function in any unit and a fresh card reader or technological device is not deployed, the election in that unit shall be cancelled and another election shall be scheduled within 24 hours if the Commission is satisfied that the result of the election in that polling unit will substantially affect the final result of the whole election and declaration of a winner in the constituency concerned”. “Also in Section 51.—“(2) Where the number of votes cast at an election\\nin any polling unit exceeds the number of accredited voters in that polling unit, the Presiding officer shall cancel the result of the election in that polling unit. “(3) Where the result of an election is cancelled in accordance with subsection (2), there shall be no return for the election until another poll has taken place in the affected polling unit. “(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) the Commission may, if satisfied that the result of the election will not substantially be affected by voting in the area where the election is cancelled, direct that a return of the election be made,” the statement partly read. The organisations further stated that INEC must abide by the provisions of the Electoral Act by verifying all the results submitted, mostly manually, through the use of the BVAS report. They added that from their standpoint as civil society organisations, they are worried that the statement released by INEC over the failure of the IREV reeks of irresponsibility and is at best flimsy. Strong and sure steps must be taken to correct the impact of the identified contraventions. To improve the transparency and integrity of the election results, the groups urged the Commission to do the following: INEC should without delay publish all the BVAS accreditation data across all the polling units where elections were held, including the number of voters accredited by fingerprints and facial recognition. According to YIAGA, BVAS was successfully deployed in about 90% of polling units. This confirms that BVAS data will improve the integrity of the results and help to detect differences that might exist. INEC cannot downplay the electronic transmission of results at this point of the process. We urge the Commission to restore the IReV platform and scrutinize all the results uploaded with BVAS data before the results are accepted. There is no way to restitute for the thousands of disenfranchised Nigerians despite having their PVCs and turning out. A public apology to these voters as well as a solid commitment to protect the integrity of the results and the process in the remaining part of this election should be given desired priority. This is not a matter of discretion but that of the law. All of these must be done as proof of INEC’s accountability and integrity of the collation process. Recall that in October 2022, Prof Mahmood Yakubu was quoted saying, “Let me once again reassure Nigerians that there is no going back on the deployment of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for voter accreditation. There is no going back on the transmission of results to the INEC Result Viewing Portal (IReV) in real-time on Election Day.”  PROMAD and Policy Shapers urged the INEC chairman to be responsible and stand accountable for his promise to Nigerians. They commended sister organisations, security apparatus, the media, ad hoc officials, foreign and local observers, and every Nigerian that is participating in this process to uphold the nation’s democracy and build the Nigeria collectively desired. © \\xa0Channels Incorporated Limited.

Below are six key things we know about the election so far. Voting on Saturday spilled over into Sunday with many Nigerians ensuring that their votes count, this left room for late collations of results at many polling units and ultimately causing a delay in the time for collation of results at the state level. The process continues and more results keep trickling in even as the people anticipate pronouncement of results. The election did not go without violence as there were several reports of\\xa0 incidences of barbarity recorded across the country, however, it is imperative to say that most of these incidences did not stop the electorates from exercising their franchise. INEC has only declared the results of Nine states officially. All results from the state are supposed to be taken to Abuja where the National Collation Centre is situated and there the results are announced for Nigeria and the world to be officially informed about the election outcome. States whose results officially announced include; Ekiti, Oyo, Kwara, Ogun, Osun, Yobe, Adamawa, Lagos and Gombe At the moment we already know the outcome of the presidential election in at least 12 states. Nine officially announced and the other three announced at state level. State whose outcome we know at this time include; Ekiti, Oyo, Kwara, Ogun, Osun, Yobe, Adamawa, Lagos, Enugu, Gombe, Jigawa and Katsina. At the time of filing this report, APC and PDP seem to have a tie with five states each. States won by the Tinubu include –\\xa0 Ekiti, Oyo, Kwara, Jigawa, and Ogun. The states won by Atiku include – Osun, Katsina, Yobe, Gombe, and Adamawa. Meanwhile, the Labour Party is coming behind with two states and they include, Lagos and Enugu. A major promise made by INEC was to deploy the IRev to limit human error in result collation and also to ensure that the process fair to everyone. However the system had a couple of issues in various places and this have got some parties and even some Nigerians very worried. INEC has said that the issues are being resolved however, some party agents at the National Collation Centre have staged a work out, saying they have lost faith in the process. The results for the FCT and 27 other states are expected in the coming hours, and a clear path to victory does not seem to have been charted for any party yet. We are keeping our eyes on the development even as results from the National Assembly polls continue to show how dynamic the 2023 elections are. \\xa0 © \\xa0Channels Incorporated Limited.
